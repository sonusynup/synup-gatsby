                    <h5>Challenges</h5>
                    <p>As an agency, Ahead of the Web has a sizable clientele of
                        multi-location businesses. Their concentrated efforts have gone towards improving the online
                        presence for dental practices. SEO forms the base of the overall marketing strategy that the
                        team recommends to their clients.</p>
                    <p>While taking on the task of servicing a niche category like dental
                        practices, Ahead of
                        the Web knew that it was going to be a difficult task. The three pillars, that they believe to
                        serve as a
                        foundation to their SEO strategy are → Optimizing on-page SEO for client websites, white-hat
                        link building and
                        ensuring uniformity of business location data. </p>
                    <p>They understood quickly that the volume of manual labour involved in
                        online business
                        listings and citation building was going to be enormous. Ahead of the Web was in charge of
                        managing multiple
                        locations of individual dental practices. Their aim was to improve local search rankings for
                        each of these dental
                        practice locations’. In order to achieve this, it was imperative to uniformly sync each of
                        their business
                        information on the internet.
                        <p> Apart from achieving uniformity of business listings online,
                            Ahead of the Web was also looking to build citations for each of their clients on the top
                            sites like Mapquest, Merchant Circle, Manta, Local, Angie's List etc. Once the presence for
                            each of their clients had been created on these platforms, they needed the ability to
                            instantly make edits - as and when required.></p>
                        <p>As it is known, the business hours for dental practices are
                            ever-changing. Minute details
                            like these can prove to be
                            the difference between a local dentist acquiring a new patient or losing the appointment to
                            a nearby competitor.
                            And they were highly aware of this. </p>

                    <h5>Solutions</h5>
                    <p>In order to achieve consistent results, Ahead of the Web set out to
                        find an automated
                        solution for their tasks. Their requirements were simple → All they needed was an easy-to-use
                        platform that gave

                    <p>Ahead of the Web evaluated Synup along with a couple of other
                        competitors. By the end of
                        it, they decided to go ahead with Synup as the dashboard was easy to understand and the cost
                        involved was highly
                        competitive. Additionally, the agency picked Synup over other tools in the market because of
                        its reliability. Any
                        listing or citation that has been enabled from the Synup dashboard remains under the business
                        owner or agency’s
                        control even after the contract expires.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since Ahead of the web services multi-location businesses, they knew
                        that the process of
                        onboarding would involve adding a large set of data into the system will be cumbersome. Synup
                        proved to be a
                        hassle-free solution on that front. The marketing firm, with the help of personnel from Synup,
                        completed the
                        onboarding for their clients to the dashboard with ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>Synup’s dashboard was used by multiple people from Ahead of the Web.
                        To their benefit,
                        they found that the dashboard
                        reads with ease because of the way it was sectioned. Once a client’s location is onboard, all
                        Ahead of the Web had
                        to do was sync the data across the directories through the dashboard. Citation building was
                        just a click away. They
                        were able to suppress their clients’ duplicate listings using the dashboard. Similarly, they
                        were able to claim the
                        listings easily form the same dashboard. </p>
                    <p>With the information for each client location synced across the web,
                        it was no surprise
                        that the reports for each
                        client showed a steady increase in numbers. </p>
